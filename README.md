# BookStore-Project
You are asked to design a BookStore that keeps track of list of books and customers in a
bookstore. Your program will store book names, prices and number of available copies. Arriving 
customers will be placed in an appropriate data structure and served accordingly. Customers are 
allowed to buy a variable number of books. Your program also needs to keep track of new deliveries to 
the store, including the book names, prices and number of delivered copies. In particular, you need to 
provide methods for serving customers in the queue, processing new deliveries to the store, and 
updating the inventory of books in the store.
